# Logic Design

## Boolean algebra

- Axioms of Boolean Algebra
- Theorems

## Combinatinal logic

- AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR gate
- Truth table
- Standard representation, minterm, maxterm
- Canonical sum and product
- Karnaugh Map

## Sequential logic

Outputs depend not only on its current inputs, but **also previous inputs.**

- Synchronous and Asynchronous sequential circuits
	Synchronization is achieved by a **clock** signal in the form of a preiodic train of clock pulses.
- Storage Elements: Latch and Flip-flop

## Synchronous design

- Finite State Machine
- State tables & Diagram
- Tristate Logic and Busses
